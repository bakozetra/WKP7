# WKP7 - Library

### Hey team!

Hope you are ready for a new challenge. I have a nice one for you this week. We're going to build a library management application. The application will consist on a form to add a book, and a table listing all the books. After submitting the form, the new book will appear on the book table.

### Here is the mockup of our library app.

[You can also access the design through figma.](https://www.figma.com/file/FoD2jZb5oOGZvTUMop0nbA/WKP7?node-id=1%3A2)

### A book needs those attributes :

-   A title
-   An author
-   A genre (Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Non-fiction, Fantasy, Design, Memoirs...)
-   A number of pages
-   A status (Read or not)

### Requirements :

-   When users load the app for the first time, a list of 3 books minimum should already be present on the list. The list will always be generated dynamically with some state in the javascript.
-   Users should be able to change the read attribute status by clicking the checkbox (and the changes will be reflected in the app state)
-   Users should be able to delete a book from the list by clicking the trash icon (and reflect that in the app state as well)
-   When a user come back to the app with the same browser, they should see the same book list as it was, before they left the app. Save the current book list to your browser's _Local Storage_.

### Tips :

-   Focus on the features first, and if you have some time left, try to replicate this design.
-   Start by choosing the book data structure, and create a few of them in the code.
-   Focus on your basic app functionality first, and then try to save the state of your app to _Local Storage_.
-   I suggest you to look back to the Shopping List exercise we did together (Video 57). There is a lot of similarities between the exercise and this project ðŸ˜‰

### Good luck team ðŸ™Œ


## WKP7 - Report
1) Structure of my project .
- I have create an html which contains two section.
- There are two fucions and  one object.
- I have created an object in javaScript and I add an array into that.
- After  that , I map throught the object  and created an html for the array so  that it can show on the list of book.
- And then , I grab all of the inputs from in html. I created one fuction  and I created an html inside it I  put all of the input to get the value.
- I  add event listener to add button so when I click the button and it add another book on the list of book.

2) If had more time

- First and formost , I would like to change my method as the shopping list.
- I want to delete the book if I can.

3) Did you learn anything new while working on this?
 -  I did not learn anything new.


4) Most challenging part
- To check the checkbox and deleting  the list of the book are the most challenging. I don't know to choose  the method should I use. 

5) More explanation about specific topic.

- I have changed my method like the shopping list but it does not work and because of that I use another method. So if you can I would like you to explain more about that.

6) Any comments.
- Everything is good.
